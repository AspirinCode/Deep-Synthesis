# Deep Synthesis
A deep learning framework for predicting chemical synthesis

## Local Setup

Follow these instructions to set up Deep Synthesis on your local machine

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/kheyer/Deep-Synthesis

Run `buildEnv.sh`. This shell script will create a conda environment named `deep_synthesis`, install all required packages and download the trained model

    cd Deep-Synthesis
    chmod +x buildEnv.sh
    ./buildEnv.sh

Follow the package installation prompts.

Once package installation is complete, activate the new conda environment and start the Streamlit app

    source activate deep_synthesis
    streamlit run Synthesis/app.py local

The Streamlit app is now running locally on port 8501

## Local Inference

Once the Streamlit app is running locally, inference can be run on local hardware. There are two ways to run inference. The "Predict from String" option predicts on a single SMILES string entered into the text entry box.

Alternatively, the "Predict from File" option predicts in bulk from a text file containing multiple SMILES inputs. The inputs should be formatted with one set of reactants per line. See the example files in the `/data` directory. The "Predict from File" option expects the source file to be stored locally. The file path to the source file defaults to the `/data` directory, but can be pointed at any file path relative to the repo file.

For both prediction formats, known target product SMILES can optionally be provided. If target SMILES are provided, predictions are automatically scored.

Once predictions are generated, they can be visualized using the slider bar. Source-to-prediction attention maps are also generated.
