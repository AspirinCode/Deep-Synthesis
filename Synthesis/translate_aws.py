class LambdaInterface():
    '''
    Class to prepare data and interface with AWS Lambda function

    Data is batched in two steps.
    First the data is batched into chunks of size "payload",
    where payload is the number of samples sent to a lambda
    function during a single invocation.

    Payload sizes are hard coded based on experimenting with
    the performance of an AWS Lambda 2048 MB function

    Second, payload chunks are batched into invocation chunks
    of size "fan_size", where "fan_size" is the number of 
    concurrent lambda invocations. 
    
    Currently, "fan_size" is set to be no more than 4

    Once data is batched, running the "run_translation" function
    will use the functions in the lambda_async.py file to 
    invoke all invocation_chunks simultaneously
